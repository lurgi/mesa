Getting started with Mesa is simple! Mesa requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or higher and React 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Package Manager Installation

Mesa is available as an npm package. Choose your preferred package manager:

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Install Mesa">
    Install Mesa using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm install mesa

    # yarn
    yarn add mesa

    # pnpm
    pnpm add mesa
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Import Mesa in Your Project">
    Import the required functions in your React components:

    ```javascript
    import { proxy, useStore } from "mesa";
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Create Your First State">
    Create a proxy state object:

    ```javascript
    const state = proxy({
      count: 0,
      user: { name: "John", age: 25 }
    });
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Use State in Components">
    Subscribe to specific parts of your state:

    ```javascript
    function Counter() {
      const count = useStore(state, (s) => s.count);
      return (
        <button onClick={() => state.count++}>
          Count: {count}
        </button>
      );
    }
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Requirements

<Note title="Compatibility">
Mesa is compatible with React 18+ and requires the following peer dependencies to be installed in your project.
</Note>

| Package | Version | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| React   | ^18.0.0 \| ^19.0.0 | Yes |
| React DOM | ^18.0.0 \| ^19.0.0 | Yes |

## TypeScript Support

Mesa comes with built-in TypeScript support. No additional type definitions are needed:

```typescript
interface AppState {
  count: number;
  user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };
}

const state = proxy<AppState>({
  count: 0,
  user: { name: "John", age: 25 }
});

// Type-safe selector
const count: number = useStore(state, (s) => s.count);
```

## Bundle Size

Mesa is designed to be lightweight:

- **Minified**: ~2KB
- **Minified + Gzipped**: ~1KB
