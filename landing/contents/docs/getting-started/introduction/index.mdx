Welcome to **Mesa**! A lightweight, high-performance React state management library that provides **fine-grained reactivity** for optimal rendering performance.

## Why Mesa?

Traditional state management solutions often cause unnecessary re-renders, leading to performance bottlenecks. Mesa solves this by tracking exactly which parts of your state each component depends on, ensuring minimal updates and maximum performance.

<Note title="Key Insight">
  Mesa only re-renders components that actually need updates, not every component that subscribes to the store.
</Note>

## Core Principles

**Mesa** is built on three fundamental principles:

- **Fine-Grained Reactivity:** Track dependencies at the property level, not the object level
- **Minimal API Surface:** Just two functions - `proxy()` and `useStore()`
- **Zero Dependencies:** Lightweight with no external dependencies

### Key Features

| **Feature**           | **Description**                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fine-Grained Updates  | Only re-render components that use changed data         |
| Proxy-Based Tracking  | Efficient state change detection using JavaScript Proxy |
| TypeScript Support    | Full type safety out of the box                         |
| Nested Object Support | Deep object tracking with path-based subscriptions      |
| Minimal Bundle Size   | Zero dependencies, minimal footprint                    |
| React 18+ Compatible  | Uses useSyncExternalStore for optimal React integration |

## Basic Example

```javascript
import { proxy, useStore } from "mesa-react";

// Create a proxy state
const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
  user: { name: "John", age: 25 },
});

function Counter() {
  // Only re-renders when count changes
  const count = useStore(state, (s) => s.count);
  return <button onClick={() => state.count++}>Count: {count}</button>;
}

function UserProfile() {
  // Only re-renders when user.name changes
  const name = useStore(state, (s) => s.user.name);
  return <div>User: {name}</div>;
}
```

## Performance Benefits

Mesa's fine-grained reactivity means:

- **Fewer Re-renders:** Components only update when their specific dependencies change
- **Better Performance:** Reduced computation and DOM updates
- **Predictable Updates:** Clear understanding of what triggers each component update
- **Scalable:** Performance stays consistent as your app grows
