This guide will help you build your first Mesa application in just a few minutes. We'll create a simple counter app that demonstrates Mesa's fine-grained reactivity.

## Your First Mesa App

Let's build a counter application that showcases Mesa's core features:

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Create the State">
    First, create a proxy state object that will hold our application data:

    ```javascript
    import { proxy } from "mesa-react";

    // Create a global state
    const appState = proxy({
      count: 0,
      user: {
        name: "Guest",
        isLoggedIn: false
      }
    });
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Create Components">
    Now, create components that subscribe to specific parts of the state:

    ```jsx
    import { useStore } from "mesa-react";

    function Counter() {
      // Only re-renders when count changes
      const count = useStore(appState, (state) => state.count);

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
          <button onClick={() => appState.count++}>
            Increment
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => appState.count--}>
            Decrement
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => appState.count = 0}>
            Reset
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    function UserProfile() {
      // Only re-renders when user data changes
      const user = useStore(appState, (state) => state.user);

      return (
        <div>
          <h3>User: {user.name}</h3>
          <p>Status: {user.isLoggedIn ? "Logged In" : "Guest"}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Compose Your App">
    Combine the components to create your complete application:

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Mesa Counter App</h1>
          <Counter />
          <UserProfile />

          {/* This button only affects UserProfile, not Counter */}
          <button
            onClick={() => {
              appState.user.name = "John";
              appState.user.isLoggedIn = true;
            }}
          >
            Login as John
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Run Your App">
    Start your development server and see Mesa in action:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Try clicking the buttons and notice how only the relevant components re-render!

  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This simple example showcases Mesa's core benefits:

### Fine-Grained Updates

- Clicking "Increment" only re-renders the `Counter` component
- Clicking "Login as John" only re-renders the `UserProfile` component
- Neither affects the other, even though they share the same state object

### Simple API

- `proxy()` creates reactive state
- `useStore()` subscribes to specific data
- Direct mutations trigger updates automatically

### Performance

- Zero unnecessary re-renders
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Efficient path-based subscriptions
